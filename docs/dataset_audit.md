## 1. Uploaded Dataset Inventory & Audit Summary

| Dataset | Rows | Important Columns | Purpose | Data Quality Issues |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `backend/data/raw/indian_railways/historical_train_runs.csv` | 2,500 | `sample_id`, `train_id`, `train_number`, `train_name`, `station_code`, `timestamp`, `current_delay_minutes`, `current_speed_kmph`, `distance_remaining_km`, `scheduled_remaining_time_minutes`, `remaining_travel_time_minutes` | Historical train journey snapshots along main corridors (e.g. NDLS-HWH, NDLS-MCT, etc.) providing point-in-time train status and target remaining travel time. | Synthetic simulation dataset created by early backend scripts; lacks explicit `journey_id` session keys to link sequential snapshots of a single train run. |
| `backend/data/raw/indian_railways/indian_railway_delay_dataset.csv` | 3,000 | `train_number`, `train_name`, `source_station`, `destination_station`, `distance_km`, `date`, `season`, `day_type`, `scheduled_arrival`, `actual_arrival`, `delay_minutes`, `weather_score` | Historical origin-to-destination overall train delay dataset based on Kaggle schema (`vishwassrivastava1/indian-railway-delay-dataset`). | Contains total end-to-end journey delay rather than intermediate station snapshots; lacks point-in-time timestamps, GPS coordinates, and speed telemetry. |
| `backend/data/stations.json` | 16 | `code`, `name`, `zone`, `state`, `coordinates` (`[longitude, latitude]`) | Station Master GeoJSON containing official Indian Railways station codes, names, zone divisions, states, and exact geographical coordinates. | Covers 16 major junction nodes; must be linked via `station_code` or `source_station`. |
| `backend/data/processed/features/unified_train_features.csv` | 2,500 | `train_id`, `timestamp`, `current_delay_minutes`, `current_speed_kmph`, `distance_remaining_km`, `scheduled_remaining_time_minutes`, `historical_avg_delay_minutes`, `weather_score`, `congestion_score`, `remaining_travel_time_minutes` | Integrated feature matrix generated from `historical_train_runs.csv` for ML training. | Requires journey-aware grouping to prevent data leakage during train/test split. |
| `backend/data/processed/features/sih_integrated_features.csv` | 3,000 | `train_number`, `source_station`, `destination_station`, `distance_km`, `delay_minutes`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `rainfall_mm`, `train_avg_delay`, `station_avg_delay`, `route_avg_delay` | Integrated dataset combining Kaggle delay records with Station Master coordinates and groupby delay aggregations. | Target is overall delay (`delay_minutes`) rather than remaining journey travel time (`remaining_travel_time_minutes`). |

## 4. Key Findings & Pipeline Refinement Recommendations

1. **Journey-Aware Snapshot Construction**:
   To eliminate data leakage, train snapshots must be grouped by journey run. When performing train/test split, all snapshots belonging to a given journey must remain in either the training set or the testing set — never split across both.

2. **Target Definition Enforcement**:
   The model target is explicitly `remaining_travel_time_minutes`. Future actual arrivals/delays are strictly excluded from input features $X$.

3. **Data Transparency Standards**:
   All features displayed in the UI and served by the API are tagged with clear source labels (`LIVE`, `HISTORICAL`, `DERIVED`, `ESTIMATED`, `SIMULATED`) for complete SIH judge credibility.
